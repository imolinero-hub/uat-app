# What is UAT RI-4?

UAT RI-4 (User Acceptance Testing) is the final validation phase before go-live for the digital platforms across 11 European countries. It ensures the complete end-to-end experience — including checkout, payments, user account, and order management — works as expected in real-life conditions across Web, App, and BOSS systems.

This testing also verifies the integration with critical back-office systems (e.g., pricing, promotions, tax, fulfillment) and partner tools.

**Scope includes:**
• 11 countries: Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, UK, and Ireland
• Platforms: Web, App, BOSS, and Partner Systems
• Functional areas: Sales, eCommerce, Marketing, Contact Center, Transaction Center, Final Mile, Finance, Translation \& Localization, Analytics, Data Governance, Legal, Security (ISR), and Technology

**Cadence \& Reporting**
• Daily stand-ups at 15:00 CET
• Executive status report published in Confluence ~17:00 CET
• Ongoing defect triage with cross-functional teams

This coordinated effort involves more than 100 testers from multiple departments, validating more than 2.000 scenarios to ensure a high-quality, stable rollout.
