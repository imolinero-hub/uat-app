# What is UAT RI-4?

UAT RI-4 (User Acceptance Testing) is the final validation phase before go-live for the digital platforms across 11 European countries. It ensures the complete end-to-end experience — including checkout, payments, user account, and order management — works as expected in real-life conditions across Web, App, and BOSS systems.  
  
  
This testing also verifies the integration with critical back-office systems (e.g., pricing, promotions, tax, fulfillment) and partner tools.
